BYZANTINE ALGORITHM

Several divisions of the Byzantine army are camped outside an enemy city, each division commanded by its own general.
The generals can communicate with one another only by messenger.
After observing the enemy, they must decide upon a common plan of action. However, some of the generals may be traitors, trying to prevent the loyal generals from reaching agreement.

It's possible to have 0 or 1 traitor.

~ All loyal lieutenants obey the same order.
~ If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant obeys the order he sends.
